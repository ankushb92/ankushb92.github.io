I am an MS in Computer Science at [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/). My primary academic interests lie in Machine Learning and Algorithms. Some other areas I find interesting are Distributed Systems and Programming Language Theory. Prior to starting my Masters program, I worked for 2 years at [DataWeave](http://dataweave.com/) where I built machine learning systems primarily focused on predictive text analytics on eCommerce data. 

Here's a [link to my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17I3x_2s0uNOecegV0bmigQRc8E1wiuPb/view) if you'd like to learn more about my education and professional experience.

My other interests and hobbies include running, meditation, hiking, Movies/TV, travelling, (audio)books, and board games.
