I am a Software Engineer at [Flexport](https://www.flexport.com/) and have worked previously at Amazon (AWS) and [Coda](https://coda.io/). My primary interests lie in backend engineering and distributed systems and I love learning new things.  

Here's a [link to my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17I3x_2s0uNOecegV0bmigQRc8E1wiuPb/view) if you'd like to learn more about my educational and professional background.

My other interests and hobbies include running, meditation, hiking, Movies/TV, travelling and (audio)books.
